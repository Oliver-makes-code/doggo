# Doggo

A modern, Cargo-like, build system for C, C++, and ASM. Designed to build C/C++, without the fluff.

## Why a new build system?

I started this project because I wanted to make rust interoperating with C/C++ easier.
Initially, I will only support Clang, so I don't need to maintain sets of compiler flags and whatnot.

## Why the name?

Dog + Cargo = Doggo :3

## Project status

The project is currently in a prototyping stage.
